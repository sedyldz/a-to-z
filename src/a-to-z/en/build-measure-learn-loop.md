description: "Build measure learn cycle (a.k.a BML loops) is a method in iterative product development, coined by Eric Ries in the book Lean Startup. A product  should be developed in build-measure-learn (BML) loops to reach the product market fit quickly and effectively. The method's main idea is to build an MVP first, then have enough users use it, get feedback from them, measure, analyze learnings, and then build again with your learnings in mind. Continue doing so until you see the product market fit."
